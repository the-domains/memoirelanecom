**The Past is a Foreign Country**

_(Quote from L.P. Hartley)_

There's a crisis looming when it comes to telling the story of our era. It's like a _mass extinction _-- you know, like when the dinosaurs died out? Ways of reading and writing, relating, communicating and living are vanishing -- fast.

Meanwhile, modern life sees family members spread out across the planet. So family cohesion requires a kind of dedicated attention it rarely gets.

Dementia may be something we associate with Seniors -- but _forgetting_ affects every generation.

_Do you see any of_ your f_amily losing touch with who they are and what they come from?_
