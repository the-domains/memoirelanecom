# Family Memories of Maine
![York Beach, 1957](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e4f4d7b4-23bc-47d9-aac6-ab9e15c469b3.jpg)

Our family loved Maine.

My father was from New Hampshire, and had long travelled to Maine with his family in the summers. When I was small, this was still happening, regular as clockwork: my father, his two sisters and their families, and my Grandmother would congregate in southern Maine, near York or York Beach, during the last two weeks of August. We'd all rent cottages in one area, and spend our time by the sea or near it, with cousins and friends and every connected relation.

This all stopped when my aunt Evelyn and her family moved to California. Soon after that my other's aunt's husband died. We kept trying to go back for a couple of years, found another area to rent a cottage, but it never was the same. Then one year my mother was ill throughout our summer holiday, and we never went again.

Yet in my memory, when I look back, all those trips just blend together: salt marsh, sea air, golden sand. Great banks of dog roses, gleaming with rosehips - screen doors banging, as all us cousins run from house to house, laughing or hiding, or playing tag. Cold water, outdoor hose-downs to sluice off the sand. Clambakes, with lobsters and quahogs by the pink granite sea-break. Seagulls, and the iodine-scent of warm seaweed; and the sound of the surf. And blueberry ice-cream. And stories at bedtime, and deep, deep sleep.

Memory makes of this childhood one long summer, when everything was good.
